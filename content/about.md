---
I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science at the University of Adelaide and completed my schooling at DPS Dubai. My journey in technology has been driven by curiosity and a passion for learning, which has led me to explore a variety of fields and projects.

I have hands-on experience in areas such as automation tools, developing games, Web and API penetration testing, creating Discord and Reddit bots.My work has given me broad exposure to APIs, low-level and high-level programming. I have a strong foundational knowledge of Linux and practical experience with Git for version control. I also have experience with home labbing using platforms like Ubuntu, Proxmox, and Red Hat, as well as networking and computer servicing support.

In addition, I have participated in multiple Capture The Flag (CTF) events, achieving top 5 placements, and competed in a hackathon, further honing my problem-solving, teamwork, and communication skills.

I also have experience in data taming and prediction, utilizing models like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, KNN, and Random Forests. One of my notable projects involved analyzing voting behavior in the 2016 elections based on various factors, evaluating the accuracy of predictive models through detailed metrics.

I am always eager to expand my knowledge and take on new challenges that push the boundaries of my skills in the field of technology.
